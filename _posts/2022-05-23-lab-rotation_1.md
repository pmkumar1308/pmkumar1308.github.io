This lab rotation was done at the Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition Lab, FU Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Radoslaw Martin Cichy and Agnessa Karapetian.


Humans continuously process a variety of visual scenes and base their decisions on what they perceive. Finding spatial information in the way that these scenes are represented in the human brain is the goal of this lab rotation project. This is accomplished by doing searchlight analysis on the outcomes of decoding and distance to hyperplane analysis on EEG data generated from an experiment described in section  \ref{subsection:basis_exp}. The searchlight analysis results show which electrodes contribute to the relationship between neurological and behavioural data in the human visual perceptualÂ decision-making process.The findings of the searchlight analysis suggest that decision-making occurs close to the occipital area of the brain, which is also known to be involved in processing visual information, because the majority of the informative areas that appear between 100 and 200 ms after stimulus onset are located in the back of the brain.
